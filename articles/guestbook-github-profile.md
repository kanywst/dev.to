How do you use your GitHub Profile README?

There are so many approaches out there—listing your skill set, showcasing GitHub Stats badges, or dropping in a snake animation that eats your contribution graph.

But I wanted something **more interactive to engage with people visiting my profile.**

So, I implemented a **"Guest Book"** where anyone can leave a message.
By hacking the GitHub Issue feature, I completely automated the entire flow: from form submission, to updating the profile README, and automatically closing the issue.

## How Does It Work?

Here is all a visitor has to do:

1. Click the "Sign the Guest Book" button on the profile.
2. A streamlined Issue form opens.
3. Write a quick message and click "Submit new issue".

A few seconds later, a bot automatically adds the new message to the table on my profile, comments "Thank you!" on the issue, and casually closes it.

## Conclusion

This setup is incredibly simple, but it perfectly captures the pure "joy of automation" in programming.
Instead of just maintaining a static portfolio page, adding a little playful touch like this might spark a new connection with another engineer who happens to stumble upon your repository.

If you want to see it in action, please drop by my GitHub profile and leave a trace!
