# Introduction

I recently noticed something while profiling a high-throughput Go service: **RSA verification was suspiciously fast.**

I expected ECDSA to beat it everywhere, but the benchmarks told a different story. This rabbit hole led me to rediscover the mechanics of `65537` and why "modern" doesn't always mean "faster" for every operation.

In this article, we'll move past the textbook definitions and dive into the *actual* performance mechanics of RSA, ECDSA, and Ed25519 using Go benchmarks. We will see why legacy systems refuse to die and where the modern algorithms truly shine.

## 1. Difference Between Encryption and Signature Verification

The fundamental difference lies in their **"purpose"** and the **"direction of key usage"**.

* **Encryption**: Protects **"Confidentiality"**. Anyone can lock it (Public Key), but only the owner can open it (Private Key).
* **Digital Signature**: Protects **"Integrity"** and **"Authenticity"**. Only the owner can create it (Private Key), but anyone can verify it (Public Key).

## 2. Types of Encryption

There are broadly two types (plus hybrid):

1. **Symmetric Key Encryption**
   * **Feature:** Uses the same key for encryption and decryption. Extremely fast.
   * **Examples:** AES, ChaCha20.

2. **Public Key Encryption**
   * **Feature:** Uses a pair of keys (public/private). Computationally heavy, but solves the key distribution problem.
   * **Examples:** RSA, Elliptic Curve Cryptography.

## 3. Signature Algorithm Mechanics: Why Short Keys for ECC?

Let's compare the three major algorithms. Here, **ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)** refers to the next generation of public key cryptography using elliptic curves.

### Difference in Mathematical Hardness

RSA and ECC differ fundamentally in "how they protect".

![rsa vs ecdsa](./assets/rsa-vs-ecdsa-ed25519/rsa-vs-ecdsa.png)

### 🧐 Why are "Short Keys" Safe?

You might think "Short keys = Weak".
However, the way the "difficulty to crack" scales for an attacker is completely different.

* **RSA (Sub-exponential)**: Even if you lengthen the key, the difficulty of cracking it only rises "gently". Since efficient attack methods (like the General Number Field Sieve) have been found, keys must be extremely long to remain safe (like stacking a Jenga tower very high).
* **ECC (Exponential)**: Just lengthening the key slightly causes the cracking difficulty to **explode**. Since no efficient way to solve it has been found, even a short key ensures sufficient complexity (like a complex maze).

> **Authoritative Standard**: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines that "RSA 3072-bit" and "ECC 256-bit" have equivalent security strength (128-bit security). This is the biggest reason the modern web is migrating to ECC.

* **RSA Signature**: Relies on the difficulty of "prime factorization of huge numbers". To maintain security against advancing attack methods, very long keys of **2048~4096 bits** are required.
* **ECDSA**: Uses calculations on an **Elliptic Curve**. It achieves the same security as RSA with a key length of only **256 bits** (about 1/10 to 1/12 of RSA), dramatically improving communication efficiency.
* **Ed25519 (EdDSA)**: A modern scheme that makes ECDSA faster and safer.

## 4. Why is Signature Verification "Heavy"? (Comparison with Bitwise Ops)

When we talk about "heavy/light processing" in cryptography, the standard is **Bitwise Operations**.

### Bitwise Operations (Representative of Light Processing)
These are simple operations like "swapping 0 and 1" or "shifting left/right" that the CPU excels at.
Symmetric encryption like AES is built by combining these bitwise operations like a puzzle, so it runs incredibly fast even without dedicated hardware.

### Public Key Cryptography (Heavy Processing)
On the other hand, digital signatures involve **"mathematical calculations on huge numbers"**.
* **RSA:** Multiplying a 2048-bit number (about 600 decimal digits!) thousands of times.
* **ECC:** Jumping and moving points thousands of times on an elliptic curve graph.

Since these calculations do not fit into standard CPU registers (64-bit width), they must be calculated using software tricks, consuming vastly more time (clock cycles) than bitwise operations.

### 🍎 Analogy: Calculator vs. Giant Long Division

* **Bitwise Ops (Symmetric Key AES etc.)**
  * **Image**: "Calculating $123 + 456$ on a calculator"
  * Uses built-in CPU functions (circuits), so the answer comes out **instantly** when you press the button.

* **Big Integer Ops (Public Key RSA/ECC etc.)**
  * **Image**: "Doing **super huge long division** by taping 100 sheets of drawing paper together"
  * The CPU's calculator (register) only holds 64 digits, but RSA requires 2048 digits.
  * Therefore, it requires **muddy manual labor** (software processing) to split the numbers, calculate thousands of times, and stitch them back together.

### ⚙️ Visualization: Traffic Jam Inside the CPU

![traffic ham inside the cpu](./assets/rsa-vs-ecdsa-ed25519/traffic-jam-inside-the-cpu.png)

In this way, for a CPU, digital signature processing is like "forcing oversized cargo through a tiny door". This is why signature verification is overwhelmingly heavier than encryption (like AES).

## 5. Thorough Comparison: RSA vs ECDSA vs Ed25519

Let's visualize the "strengths and weaknesses" of each algorithm with charts (Relative scores/Conceptual diagrams based on benchmark results).

**RSA (2048)**: Verification is "Godspeed".
> **Trivia: Why so fast?** <br>
> The public exponent $e$ used in RSA verification calculation ($s^e \pmod n$) is usually **65537** ($2^{16}+1$). In binary, this is `10000000000000001`, having only two `1` bits.

Using `65537` (0x10001) as a public key might seem insecurely simple—it’s mostly zeros! However, RSA's security relies entirely on the factorization difficulty of the modulus $N$, not the complexity of the exponent $e$. This specific choice is a feature, not a bug: it allows verifiers to use the **Binary Method** to complete calculations with only 17 multiplications, whereas a random exponent would take thousands.

This architectural trade-off is why RSA verification remains incredibly lightweight compared to its heavy signing process.

![rsa performance](./assets/rsa-vs-ecdsa-ed25519/rsa-performance.png)

**ECDSA (P-256)**: Overall balanced and excellent, but it has a weakness where the private key can leak if "good quality random numbers" cannot be generated during signing.

![ecdsa performance](./assets/rsa-vs-ecdsa-ed25519/ecdsa-performance.png))

**Ed25519**: Uses "Deterministic Signatures" that do not use random numbers for signing. It is the modern champion, possessing speed, safety, and compactness.

## 6. Hands-on Experiment: Measure Speed on Your PC

Let's measure not just theory, but the actual speed difference on your local machine.
If you have a Go environment, you can run this immediately on Mac, Windows, or Linux.

### Step 1: Preparation

Create a directory and initialize a Go module.

```bash
mkdir crypto-bench
cd crypto-bench
go mod init crypto-bench
```

### Step 2: Create Benchmark Code

Save the following code as `main_test.go`.
Since it only uses Go's standard library, no extra `go get` is needed.

```go
package main

import (
	"crypto/ecdsa"
	"crypto/ed25519"
	"crypto/elliptic"
	"crypto/rand"
	"crypto/rsa"
	"crypto/sha256"
	"testing"
)

// Message hash (signature target)
var hashed = sha256.Sum256([]byte("This is a dummy message for benchmarking"))

// --- RSA Benchmark ---
func BenchmarkRSA_GenerateKey(b *testing.B) {
	for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
		_, _ = rsa.GenerateKey(rand.Reader, 2048)
	}
}
func BenchmarkRSA_Sign(b *testing.B) {
	priv, _ := rsa.GenerateKey(rand.Reader, 2048)
	b.ResetTimer()
	for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
		_, _ = rsa.SignPKCS1v15(rand.Reader, priv, 0, hashed[:])
	}
}
func BenchmarkRSA_Verify(b *testing.B) {
	priv, _ := rsa.GenerateKey(rand.Reader, 2048)
	sig, _ := rsa.SignPKCS1v15(rand.Reader, priv, 0, hashed[:])
	pub := &priv.PublicKey
	b.ResetTimer()
	for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
		_ = rsa.VerifyPKCS1v15(pub, 0, hashed[:], sig)
	}
}

// --- ECDSA Benchmark ---
func BenchmarkECDSA_GenerateKey(b *testing.B) {
	for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
		_, _ = ecdsa.GenerateKey(elliptic.P256(), rand.Reader)
	}
}
func BenchmarkECDSA_Sign(b *testing.B) {
	priv, _ := ecdsa.GenerateKey(elliptic.P256(), rand.Reader)
	b.ResetTimer()
	for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
		_, _ = ecdsa.SignASN1(rand.Reader, priv, hashed[:])
	}
}
func BenchmarkECDSA_Verify(b *testing.B) {
	priv, _ := ecdsa.GenerateKey(elliptic.P256(), rand.Reader)
	sig, _ := ecdsa.SignASN1(rand.Reader, priv, hashed[:])
	pub := &priv.PublicKey
	b.ResetTimer()
	for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
		_ = ecdsa.VerifyASN1(pub, hashed[:], sig)
	}
}

// --- Ed25519 Benchmark ---
func BenchmarkEd25519_GenerateKey(b *testing.B) {
	for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
		_, _, _ = ed25519.GenerateKey(rand.Reader)
	}
}
func BenchmarkEd25519_Sign(b *testing.B) {
	_, priv, _ := ed25519.GenerateKey(rand.Reader)
	msg := []byte("This is a dummy message for benchmarking")
	b.ResetTimer()
	for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
		_ = ed25519.Sign(priv, msg)
	}
}
func BenchmarkEd25519_Verify(b *testing.B) {
	pub, priv, _ := ed25519.GenerateKey(rand.Reader)
	msg := []byte("This is a dummy message for benchmarking")
	sig := ed25519.Sign(priv, msg)
	b.ResetTimer()
	for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
		_ = ed25519.Verify(pub, msg, sig)
	}
}
```

### Step 3: Run

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
go test -bench .
```

```

#### Interpretation of Results

* **RSA**: Key generation is devastatingly slow (90ms!), but look at that **RSA_Verify** (0.03ms). It's screaming fast. This explains why some legacy systems refuse to die—if your bottleneck is strictly verification (like in some high-volume JWT validation scenarios), RSA is still a beast.
* **Ed25519**: Reigns supreme in signing speed and offers the best overall balance. For any new system, this is the default choice.

## Summary

1. **Encryption "Hides", Signatures "Prove"**.
2. **ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)** offers equivalent security with **1/10th the key length of RSA** due to mathematical efficiency.
3. Compared to Symmetric Key Encryption which runs on **Bitwise Operations**, Digital Signatures are heavy because they perform **Huge Mathematical Operations**.
4. When in doubt, choosing **Ed25519** is the most balanced and secure choice for modern applications.

**Whats the next**

I'd like to explore NIST SP 800-57 in depth.
